A two-part project that consists of (1) a desktop application that records an employees current satisfaction state and (2) a Tableau dashboard that provides insights based off of that data.

## Project Overview
**Framework:** Kivy (Python) <br/>
**Team Members:** Patrik Drean, Josh Drean, Alexander Noren<br/>

## Project Details
In this modern age, managers are collecting so much data to make better informed decision; however, they are neglecting one of their most
important resources - employees. This MVP (minimum viable product) is designed to create a way to (1) collect data on employee 
satisfaction/mood and (2) analyze this data in a clear and powerful way by using a Tableau dashboard.

## Lessons Learned 
<ul>Â  
  <li>Kivy is a new framework for me. It's very powerful in certain regards, but (for me) it didn't live up to the hype. But it was beneficial to learn.</li>
  <li>Utilized elephantsql.com as a free PostgreSQL database that can scale easily.</li>
  <li>Deployed to an .exe program for the first time on Windows.</li>
</ul>
